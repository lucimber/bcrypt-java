## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- Initial release of lucimber-bcrypt library
- Pure Java implementation of BCrypt password hashing algorithm
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Support for BCrypt 2a and 2b variants
- Full compatibility with Spring Security BCrypt
- Full compatibility with Bouncy Castle BCrypt
- Domain-driven design with immutable value objects
- Comprehensive test suite (110 tests)
- Java 9+ module support (JPMS)
- Self-documenting JAR with usage help
- Maven Central publishing configuration
- SPDX license headers

### Features
- `BCryptService` - Main service interface (singleton pattern)
- `Password` - Secure password value object with memory clearing
- `Hash` - BCrypt hash representation with parsing and validation
- `Salt` - 16-byte salt with BCrypt Base64 encoding
- `CostFactor` - Work factor configuration (4-31)
- `BCryptVersion` - Algorithm version enum (2a/2b)
- Constant-time password comparison for security
- Automatic password truncation at 72 bytes (BCrypt specification)
- SecureRandom for salt generation

### Security
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Secure memory handling with Password.clear() method
- Rejection of empty passwords
- Default cost factor of 10 for balanced security/performance
